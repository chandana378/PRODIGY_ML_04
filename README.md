Description
The project's aim is to develop a Calorie Estimation model to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. We mainly develop a Deep Learning model that identifies the food present in the given image. For this purpose, we utilize CNN Architecture in the model. The model is trained over 75,000 images in total, and, produces an accuracy of .

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Food 101 dataset, available from Kaggle. It contains images of food, organized by type of food. It was used in the Paper "Food-101 â€“ Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests" by Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin and Luc Van Gool. It's a good (large dataset) for testing computer vision techniques.

The dataset has 75,000+ images for training, and, 15,000+ images for testing purposes.
